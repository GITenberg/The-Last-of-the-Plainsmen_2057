description: Fictionalized biography of Colonel Charles Jesse Jones ("Buffalo Jones"),
  1844-1919, a frontiersman and wild game hunter. Jones, the last of the plainsmen,
  and several associates venture into the region of Buckskin Mountain, along the northern
  rim of the Grand Canyon. In a continuing quest to establish dominion over wild animals,
  Jones leads his men on a journey to capture untamed cougars and bring them back
  alive. After several run-ins with Navajo, Commanche, Yellow Knife and Great Slave
  Indians, Jones finally captures his first wild cougar.
